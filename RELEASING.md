# Release Instructions

Given how the codebase underlying EDICTOR has evolved over time, with me learning more about JavaScript trying to catch up with new knowledge acquired over time, the code base is at the moment quite difficult to maintain, mixing both code related to the GUI with routines related to sequence comparison in various ways, without using proper tests. 

Given that the tool still works most of the time, and errors are usually tracked quickly and then fixed somehow, it seems better to go on in this way, trying to enhance the tool as we go along, rather than making a complete cut and programming it from scratch (there would anyway be no time for this).
 
But from version 3.0 on, there is some hope that basic release procedures can be established and used, along with certain manual tests for which individual datasets with only a few items should be prepared.

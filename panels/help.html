<h3>How to use the Wordlist-Editor </h3>
In order to use the wordlist editor, you will need a valid input file. This file should be structured as a Wordlist file with the first line indicating the names of all columns and the first column pointing to a unique ID for each row of the file.

<h4>Filtering</h4>
The Wordlist-Editor allows you to filter the entries in multiple ways. 
With help of the text fields, you can select that only
<ul>
  <li>specific taxa,</li><br>
  <li>specific concepts, or</li><br>
  <li>specific columns</li><br>
  <li>specific entries</li><br>
</ul>
are displayed. 
For taxa and concepts, just type in the name of the taxon or concept you want to select and separate multiple taxa and concept by a comma. For the filtering of columns, you may also toggle between the display of the basic columns (default) and all columns by pressing [F4], or you may select the columns within the settings menu (press [F2] to show or close the settings).
In order to filter specific entries, type &quot;COLUMNNAME = entry&quot;, where COLUMNAME is the name of one of the columns in the data, and entry is one entry you want to search for. Using &quot;=&quot; will search for all entries which <em>contain</em> the given string. If you want to search for a direct match, use &quot;==&quot; instead.

<h4>Navigation</h4>
Having entered the insert mode (just click on any of the cells of the table or press [CTRL+I]), you can navigate with key up and key down from cell to cell along the same column. If you want to navigate between columns within the same row, use [CTRL+LEFT] and [CTRL+RIGHT]. Having modified the content of a cell, you can submit the modification by navigating to the next neighboring cell or by pressing [ENTER]. The letter will also close the insert mode. In order to leave the insert mode without submitting any modifications, just press [ESC].
